My name is Tony Hammack, and I am a machine learning engineer - currently at Meazure Learning. 

As an avid reader and podcast listener, I love to embrace the challenge of learning new things that are outside my realm of knowledge. I believe that human life has nearly unlimited potential, and the only key to unlock it is through knowledge and grit. My goal is to use my resources and talents to affect change in this world, and help everyone reach their potential.
