For my day job, I am a machine learning engineer. When I am not working, I like to watch tv shows and movies, workout, and tinker with new tech.

As an avid reader and podcast listener, I love to embrace the challenge of learning new things that are outside my realm of knowledge. I believe that human life has nearly unlimited potential, and the only key to unlock it is through knowledge and grit. My goal is to use my resources and talents to affect change in this world, and help everyone reach their potential.
